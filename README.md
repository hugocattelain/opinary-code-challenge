## Getting started

To run the project locally, run the following commands :

- cd ..
- npm start

If the last command does not automatically open the app in your browser, follow this URL: http://localhost:3000/

## Features

The poll widget has two default questions set (one per page).
To change de questions/answers, open https://opinary-code-challenge.herokuapp.com/

Then, reload the previously opened static HTML files.

The user can answer only once to each question.

When a question is changed, the answers count is reset.
